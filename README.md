# CS-360---Project-Three

The app I created is a weight-tracking tool designed to give users a practical and personalized way to monitor their weight over time, set meaningful goals, and stay motivated through notifications. It’s built for people who want a simple yet effective way to stay on top of their health and fitness without being bogged down by extra features they won’t use.

Supporting user needs meant designing a series of essential screens, including a login screen, weight input and history tracking, and a goal-setting area. Each screen’s layout was intentionally clean and easy to navigate, keeping users focused on their progress and goals. I worked to make the interface as user-centered as possible by prioritizing clarity and simplicity. This attention to layout paid off, as the design empowers users to quickly access data, enter updates, and see progress in a way that feels seamless.

My approach to coding was methodical. I broke the app’s functionality into small, manageable tasks and used modular techniques to keep things organized. This way of building the app ensured each feature could be added or updated independently, making the codebase clearer and easier to maintain. These methods are ones I can see myself relying on in future projects, especially those that require flexible, well-structured code.

Testing was a vital part of development. I took time to test each piece as I added it, focusing on functionality, stability, and reliability in core areas like data handling and user interactions. This testing revealed a few areas needing adjustment and gave me confidence in the app’s functionality and smooth user experience.

In terms of challenges, the most creative problem-solving came when integrating the goal notification feature. This involved fine-tuning permissions and coding specifics to ensure smooth notifications that keep users engaged without being intrusive. I felt the database component was a particular success, where my skills in data management really shone. This feature allows users to store, retrieve, and update data effortlessly, creating a foundation for a reliable, user-friendly experience.
